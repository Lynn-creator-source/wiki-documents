# Application Title (e.g., Object Detection on Jetson)

## 1. Overview

- Brief description of the AI application's purpose and function
- Typical use cases and industries (e.g., security, industrial inspection, smart city)
- Demo screenshot or short video (optional but recommended)

## 2. Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- Jetson board model (Nano, Xavier NX, AGX Orin, etc.)
- Camera/sensors/peripherals (if applicable)

### Software Environment

- JetPack version
- Python/C++ version
- Required libraries (e.g., PyTorch, OpenCV, TensorRT)

### Model Preparation

- Use of pre-trained or custom-trained models
- Model format (.pt / .onnx / .engine)
- Model download link or conversion steps

## 3. Development & Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Input Processing

- Reading from camera, image, or video stream
- Preprocessing (resize, normalization, etc.)

### Step 2: Model Loading and Inference

- Framework used (PyTorch / ONNX Runtime / TensorRT)
- Code snippet for loading the model
- Explanation of inference steps

### Step 3: Post-processing and Visualization

- Decoding output results
- Drawing bounding boxes / labels
- Visual example of output

## 4. Performance and Optimization

- Inference speed (FPS)
- CPU/GPU utilization
- Comparison: FP32 vs FP16 vs INT8
- Optimization tips with TensorRT or DeepStream

## 5. Troubleshooting

- Model loading errors?
- Low accuracy or incorrect output?
- Performance bottlenecks?
- Debugging tips (logs, system monitoring, etc.)

## 6. Possible Extensions

- Replacing model (e.g., upgrade from YOLOv5 to YOLOv8)
- Multi-camera input support
- Integrate with ROS, MQTT, or REST APIs
- CUDA stream / multithreaded inference
